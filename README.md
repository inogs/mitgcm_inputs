## MITgcm input generator

Welcome to the MITgcm input generator repository! This repository contains
tools that can be used to generate the static files that describe the
physical and biogeochemical properties of a geographical domain.
These files are specifically designed for data that has been discretized
using the [`bathytool`](https://github.com/inogs/bathytools) software.
